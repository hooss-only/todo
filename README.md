# TODOS-ONLY
A cli todo list program.<br>
made by hooss-only

## About the program
As I usually use cli enviroment when I code, I need a todo list program that run on cli.<br>
So I made this program and practiced golang too.

## How to use
1. clone my repository and install Golang
2. get $GOPATH with `go env GOPATH`
3. type `go build $GOPATH/bin` in cloned folder
4. goto home folder (or any folder) type `todo`.
5. enjoy
